# ImageScraperPin
This code scrapes images from Pinterest boards.
The username, password and the location to the chromeDriver, csv file and download directory have been given at the top of the code. Change those to run it.
I've included the version of chromeDriver that I've used but you might have to download a compatible version from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
